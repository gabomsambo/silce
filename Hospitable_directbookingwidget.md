I've thoroughly reviewed the transcript! Here's what I've learned about integrating Hospitable's direct booking widget into a self-hosted website:

## Key Setup Steps:

1. **Initial Setup**: Click "add my site" under "self-hosted site" in Hospitable
2. **Select Properties**: Identify which properties to include on your site
3. **Get Widget Code**: You'll receive code snippets that need to be embedded in your website

## Widget Customization:

- **Color Styling**: Customizable color schemes with hex codes to match your brand
- **Property Search**: Optional multi-property search feature (can be enabled/disabled)
- **Custom Features**: You can add elements not supported on Hospitable-hosted sites (like WhatsApp contact buttons)

## Critical Requirements:

- **One Page Per Property**: Each property needs its own dedicated page with the widget embedded
- **Widget Code Placement**: Needs to be added in a block/section on your site (implementation varies by site builder)
- **URL Registration**: After embedding, you must add each property page URL back into Hospitable's system

## Three Implementation Patterns:

1. **Single Property Links**: Individual "Book Now" buttons → direct to property pages
2. **Multi-Property Search**: Search bar with date selection → results page → property pages
3. **Popup Widget**: Modal/overlay implementation of the booking widget

## Final Integration:

- The widget reads live availability from Hospitable
- Connects bookings back to your Hospitable account
- Links to Google vacation rental results

**I'm ready to help you implement this in your coding environment!** What type of site are you working with, and which implementation pattern interests you?

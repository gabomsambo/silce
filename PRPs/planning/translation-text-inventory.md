## Translation Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Approach:
1. **Use next-intl or similar i18n library** for Next.js 15 App Router
2. **Create translation JSON files** organized by component/page
3. **Extract all text to translation keys** following the structure of this inventory
4. **Implement language toggle** in Navbar (already has placeholder button)
5. **Add Spanish language route** (`/es/*` or use locale subdomain)
6. **Update metadata** with `alternates.languages` for SEO

### Priority Order:
1. **Phase 1 (Critical):** Navigation, CTA buttons, form labels
2. **Phase 2 (High):** Page headings, hero text, metadata
3. **Phase 3 (Medium):** Body paragraphs, descriptions
4. **Phase 4 (Low):** Review text (optional - may keep original)

### String Count Summary:
- **Navigation & UI Elements:** ~50 strings
- **Headings:** ~40 strings
- **Body Text:** ~60 strings
- **Form Fields & Validation:** ~30 strings
- **Metadata (SEO):** ~25 strings
- **Category & Amenity Data:** ~40 strings

**Total Estimated Strings:** ~245 unique translation keys
